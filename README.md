# Firefighter_Scuttle
Collaberation Project by: Carlos Espinal, Kyle Grosman, and Dean Vicera

## What is it
Using the Scuttle Bot provided in the MXET 300 class, we have modified it to be able to detect fires and put them out. This project
utilizes various autonomous processes to accurately patrol a given space, determine the location
of a fire, and execute the functions necessary to dispose of said fire. To determine the efficacy of
the system when fully constructed, multiple real world simulations were performed. These tasks
were aimed at testing the SCUTTLE’s limits and capabilities given its directive. Tasks were
performed to stress test the strength of the SCUTTLE’s altered model, determine how effectively
it can put out fires of multiple sizes, and effectively avoid obstacles and navigate around them.
The importance of this project is in its inherent challenging of our abilities. The team was tasked
with using the resources made available to create a completely closed-loop system aimed at
achieving a given task while simultaneously performing counter measures to avoid operational
impedances.
